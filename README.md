# hello-world
This is a repository I built on GitHub. I am currently learning to code with Python, and it is my first programming language to learn. Which was why I was so excited to hear that my school was now teaching Python instead of C#. Everything is very different now that all my schooling is online only, and I miss the many opportunities that going to an actual classroom provides.
